            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The reason I have developed motivation to apply for the Department of Media Studies is because I find great appeal in being a creator who uses various mediums to convey diverse stories and bring about positive changes in people's lives. I have had an interest in various art forms such as film, music, and photography. Therefore, since high school, I started creating various media works. It was incredibly enjoyable to shoot and edit videos to create my own stories. As my interest in media deepened, I gained even greater curiosity and passion for the role of production.</p>
